## Description:
This program is a tool to be used for using various fontsets available via Unicode in other applications.
When activated the program replaces the letters from a-z with the letters of a currently selected fontset
regardless where you type in your text. Fonts can be defined via text-files. It uses UTF-16 encoding.
Note: The target window where you type must support UTF-16 encoding in order to display the fontset
properly. If not, it may result in unwanted characters.

## Usage:
* Start the program
* Select a fontset of your choice (remembered on next program start)
* Activate the tool
* Your selected fontset is now available wherever you type
* Deactivate the tool in order to use normal letters again
* The program can be started with the parameter "-hide" in order to hide it on startup

## System Requirements:
* Platform: x64
* Operating System: Windows 10/11
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 x64 Redistributable
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1
